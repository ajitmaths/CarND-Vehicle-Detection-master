    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm needs to learn to detect a car in picture. The best way is to train the algorithm with lot of images, labeled \"cars\" and \"non cars\". I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  There are 8792 car images and 8968 non car Images which are 64*64 pixels.\n",
    "Here is an random example of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "HOG stands for “Histogram of Oriented Gradients”. Basically, it divides an image in several pieces. For each piece, it calculates the gradient of variation in a given number of orientations. I  explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The less the number of pixels per cells (and other parameters), more general the data. The high the number of pixels per cells (and other parameters) more specific. By playing with the parameters, I found that orientations above 7, and 8 pixels per cell are enough to identify a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for extracting HOG features from an image is defined by the method `get_hog_features`.  The figure below shows a comparison of a car image and its associated histogram of oriented gradients, as well as the same for a non-car image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `extract_features` in the section titled \"Method to Extract HOG Features from an Array of Car and Non-Car Images\" accepts a list of image paths and HOG parameters (as well as one of a variety of destination color spaces, to which the input image is converted), and produces a flattened array of HOG features for each image in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, in the section titled \"Extract Features for Input Datasets and Combine, Define Labels Vector, Shuffle and Split,\" I define parameters for HOG feature extraction and extract features for the entire dataset. These feature sets are combined and a label vector is defined (`1` for cars, `0` for non-cars). The features and labels are then shuffled and split into training and test sets in preparation to be fed to a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The table below documents the twenty-five different parameter combinations that I explored.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the section titled \"Train a Classifier\" I trained a linear SVM with the default classifier parameters and using HOG features alone (I did not use spatial intensity or channel intensity histogram features) and was able to achieve a test accuracy of __97.8%__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sliding Window Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "I adapted the method `find_cars` from the lesson materials. The method combines HOG feature extraction with a sliding window search, but rather than perform feature extraction on each window individually which can be time consuming, the HOG features are extracted for the entire image (or a selected portion of it) and then these full-image features are subsampled according to the size of the window and then fed to the classifier. The method performs the classifier prediction on the HOG features for each window region and returns a list of rectangle objects corresponding to the windows that generated a positive (\"car\") prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows the first attempt at using `find_cars` on one of the test images, using a single window size:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image14]\n",
    "\n",
    "I explored several configurations of window sizes and positions, with various overlaps in the X and Y directions. The following four images show the configurations of all search windows in the final implementation, for small (1x), medium (1.5x, 2x), and large (3x) windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "\n",
    "The final algorithm calls `find_cars` for each window scale and the rectangles returned from each method call are aggregated. In previous implementations smaller (0.5) scales were explored but found to return too many false positives, and originally the window overlap was set to 50% in both X and Y directions, but an overlap of 75% in the Y direction (yet still 50% in the X direction) produced more redundant true positive detections, which were preferable given the heatmap strategy described below. Additionally, only an appropriate vertical range of the image is considered for each window size (e.g. smaller range for smaller scales) to reduce the chance for false positives in areas where cars at that scale are unlikely to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows the rectangles returned by `find_cars` drawn onto one of the test images in the final implementation. Notice that there are several positive predictions on each of the near-field cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a true positive is typically accompanied by several positive detections, while false positives are typically accompanied by only one or two detections, a combined heatmap and threshold is used to differentiate the two. The `add_heat` function increments the pixel value (referred to as \"heat\") of an all-black image the size of the original image at the location of each detection rectangle.

    "The final implementation performs very well, identifying the near-field vehicles in each of the images with no false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first implementation did not perform as well, so I began by optimizing the SVM classifier. The original classifier used HOG features from the YUV channel only, and achieved a test accuracy of 96.28%. Using all three YUV channels increased the accuracy to 98.40%, but also tripled the execution time. However, changing the `pixels_per_cell` parameter from 8 to 16 produced a roughly ten-fold increase in execution speed with minimal cost to accuracy (97.80%).\n",

    "The code for processing frames of video is contained in the cell titled \"Pipeline for Processing Video Frames\" and is identical to the code for processing a single image described above, with the exception of storing the detections (returned by `find_cars`) from the previous 15 frames of video using the `prev_rects` parameter from a class called `Vehicle_Detect`. Rather than performing the heatmap/threshold/label steps for the current frame's detections, the detections for the past 15 frames are combined and added to the heatmap and the threshold for the heatmap is set to `1 + len(det.prev_rects)//2` (one more than half the number of rectangle sets contained in the history) - this value was found to perform best empirically (rather than using a single scalar, or the full number of rectangle sets in the history).\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems that I faced while implementing this project were mainly concerned with detection accuracy. Balancing the accuracy of the classifier with execution speed was crucial. Example, Scanning 190 windows using a classifier that achieves ~98% accuracy should result in around 4 misidentified windows per frame. Of course, integrating detections from previous frames mitigates the effect of the misclassifications, but it also introduces another problem: vehicles that significantly change position from one frame to the next (e.g. oncoming traffic) will tend to escape being labeled. Producing a very high accuracy classifier and maximizing window overlap might improve the per-frame accuracy to the point that integrating detections from previous frames is unnecessary (and oncoming traffic is correctly labeled), but it would also be far from real-time without massive processing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is probably most likely to fail in cases where vehicles (or the HOG features thereof) don't resemble those in the training dataset, but lighting and environmental conditions might also play a role (e.g. a white car against a white background) .As stated above, oncoming cars are an issue, as well as distant cars (as mentioned earlier, smaller window scales tended to produce more false positives, but they also did not often correctly label the smaller, distant cars).\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe better approach would be to combine a very high accuracy classifier with high overlap in the search windows. The execution cost could be offset with more intelligent tracking strategies, such as:\n",
    "- determine vehicle location and speed to predict its location in subsequent frames\n",
    "- use a convolutional neural network, to preclude the sliding window search altogether"
